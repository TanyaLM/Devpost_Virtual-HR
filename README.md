# Devpost_Virtual-HR
## Inspiration- Interview procedure at my company was becoming so tedious , such that applicants were coming up with fake profiles and it was costing up our time and money without giving any output.We needed candidates who atleast had some basic technical knowledge about their domain and once selected for the first screening round , the candidate could be further evaluated.So we decided to take it up and automate it using UIPath . 

## What it does:Following tasks can be accomplished by our HR Bot:
>Reads the requirements for the candidate
>Searches for candidates with desired requirements on Linked In
>Extracts the data from Linked In profile and sends the candidate an email for updated resume and latest photograph
>Once the resume is received , scheduling a skype interview with the candidate 
>On that particular date and time , we conduct the screening round with the candidate
>For successful candidates ,the 2nd Technical Round is conducted through video calling .
> For those candidates who are finally selected , the HR is informed 
>The Candidate is sent a confirmation mail for selection and requested for the desired documents for Onboarding formalities.
>Once documents received from the candidate , the documents are validated and candidature is confirmed from our company.

## How we built it: We built our bot mainly  using Uipath, Chat Bot integration with Skype , Face Detection , AI with ML  and RPA.

## Challenges we ran into: Skype integration and Chatbot training

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: Understanding unstructured text, Face detection , and ChatBot which is working on the mobile as well.Performing an end to end recruitment process for our company without any harassment to the HR and the technical team.Also having skype and chatbot together makes it a full fledged working Bot.

## What we learned:Understanding unstructured text, Face detection , and ChatBot which is working on the mobile as well.Performing an end to end recruitment process for our company without any harassment to the HR and the technical team.Also having skype and chatbot together makes it a full fledged working Bot.

## What's next for Virtual HR: It is ready for action .Though we are trying to integrate Voice calls on Skype.Also trying include the Bot carrying out Backgroundverification with the candidate's guaranters.
